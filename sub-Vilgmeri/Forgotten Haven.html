        In the old times of the divided kingdom of R'Oth Vilgmeri, the Glimmering Dawn was the access point for traders
        all across Amalon. The harbor was grand and beautiful, welcoming hundreds of sailors, day and night. Once king
        Tymir died, and his brother Huros had chosen to abandon the harbor, it has fallen to disrepair. The wood
        deteriorated over time, and the harbor became obsolete. The once-beautiful harbor had become a forgotten haven.
