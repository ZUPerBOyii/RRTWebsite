        Far Lost, also known as "The Crying City," is a region steeped in tragedy and mystery within the kingdom of
        R'Oth Vilgmeri. The city, originally named Vilharjak, was once a thriving metropolis under the leadership of
        King Tymir. It was part of the kingdom's ambitious plan to unify the divided parts of Vilgmeri—Vo Janthir (Upper
        Sanctuary) and Kjo Janthir (Lower Sanctuary)—under a single banner. This unification was led by Tymir and his
        brother Huros, who sought to merge their kingdoms' industrial advancements and magical studies.
    </p>

    <p> After Tymir's untimely death due to illness, Huros inherited the throne and continued his brother's work.
        However, the cultural and linguistic differences between the two regions made unification difficult, and Huros'
        attempts to consolidate power ultimately failed, leading to civil unrest. In an effort to solidify the
        unification, Huros erected a colossal city near the Mountains of R'Oth, intended to serve as a symbol of unity.
    </p>

    <p> This grand vision, however, became the king's downfall. The project cost Huros his life and left the kingdom
        without a monarch, plunging the region into chaos. As the political situation deteriorated, the inhabitants of
        Vilharjak became increasingly isolated. Those who sought peace left the city, establishing new settlements such
        as the city now known as Grace of Ami, while others moved to the nearby mountains.
    </p>

    <p> Over time, the city's infrastructure collapsed due to neglect, drought, and failed irrigation systems, leading
        to the formation of a desert. The once-prosperous city began to decay, its trade routes fell silent, and its
        lands became barren. In a desperate attempt to contain the situation, the new government decided to isolate
        Vilharjak from the mainland, surrounding it with walls and restricting the flow of resources. The population was
        left to fend for itself, with only minimal rations provided to stave off complete starvation.
    </p>

    <p>
        Years later, a devastating earthquake struck the region, causing the sands beneath Vilharjak to swallow the city
        whole. The once-great metropolis vanished, leaving behind only barren land covered with ceramic and stone. The
        city came to be known as Far Lost, a name that echoes the tragedy of its disappearance and the mysterious fate
        of its inhabitants.
    </p>

    <p> Today, Far Lost is a place of eerie silence, with ruins that whisper of its dark past. Travelers who dare to
        explore the area claim to hear the cries of the long-forgotten city at night, and some believe that the souls of
        the dead still linger, haunting those who venture too close. The city remains shrouded in legend, with tales of
        curses and restless spirits that continue to captivate the imagination of those who hear its story.
