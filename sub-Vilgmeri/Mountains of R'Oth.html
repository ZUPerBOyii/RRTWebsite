    <h1>Mountains of R'Oth</h1>
    <p>
        The Mountains of R'Oth are a significant geographical feature within the kingdom of R'Oth Vilgmeri. These
        mountains serve as both a natural barrier and a critical strategic asset. The rugged terrain and the harsh
        conditions of the mountains make them difficult to traverse, which has historically provided R'Oth Vilgmeri with
        a natural defense against invasions and external threats.
    </p>

    <p> When Vilgmeri was a divided kingdom, split in two parts, known as the Upper Sanctuary and the Lower Sanctuary,
        the king had tried uniting the two parts into one. He planted the flag where now the capital Vilgmeri stands,
        erecting the city of contant progress. However, this decision caused the very king's death. Those who didn't
        want to be part of this unification, moved to the mountains, erecting a small city of their own, known as the
        Nur Oldamor. Later, during the First War, the Valomorians attacked Nur Oldamor after destroying one of the Four,
        allowing them to capture the city and bring it under their control. That night, the city was taken back by the
        Vilgmeri, using their immense Titans, granting them enough power to fight the Valomorians off.
    </p>

    <p>The Mountains of R'Oth continue to be a defining feature of the kingdom, shaping both its history and its
        present-day culture. The legacy of the city built at its base and the ongoing struggles of those who live in its
        shadow are a testament to the resilience and determination of the people of R'Oth Vilgmeri.
