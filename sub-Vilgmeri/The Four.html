        The Four are a collection of four towers that stand tall, watching over the continent of Vilgmeri. The story
        behind these buildings remains shrouded in mystery, seeing as they wenre't built by the Vilgmeri themselves. The
        only written record found about the Four, was mostly burnt and impossible to read. However, whatever the
        scientists managed to decipher, was enough to make them believe that the Four aren't towers, but gateways to a
        world, disconnected from the physical realm. It is said, that from said worl, originate the Whisperers, beings
        of great power that have no physical form.

    <p>
        The Four are equipped with a large brazier, which when lit up, sends a signal to the other Four, warning them of
        iminent danger. The only time these have ever activated before, was during the First War, when the Valomorians
        invaded the Vilgmeri. During the siege, one of the Four was destroyed, disconnecting them from one another.

        However, when the Valomorians attacked again many years later, the Four were reignited once again, thanks to the
        great enchanter Zo Rei Wu, who with his knowledge of Ervenian enchantments, managed to repair the damaged Four,
        helping them defeat the tyrant Aradoth.
