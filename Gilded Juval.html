    <p>Gilded Juval is a kingdom marked by extreme disparities between its two main social classes: the obscenely
        wealthy elite and the destitute poor. The rich, so engulfed in their wealth, often struggle to find ways to
        spend their immense fortunes, while the poor face a daily struggle to survive. This stark division has made the
        kingdom notorious for its cutthroat political landscape, where power and wealth dictate every facet of life​.
    </p>
    <p>
        The kingdom’s capital is a hub of wealth and extravagance, with streets adorned by opulent architecture and
        bustling markets filled with gold and luxury goods. One of Gilded Juval’s defining characteristics is its
        vibrant but ruthless trade economy. The kingdom is recognized as one of the most influential trade empires in
        Amalon. However, much of this wealth is concentrated among the elite, with the poorer classes being excluded
        from most of the benefits and forced into harsh conditions. The city of Jua La Va, a key part of the kingdom, is
        famous for its rapid technological advancements and military production, including specialized weapons like the
        quick-dissolving "rasha" that coats objects in a golden hue​​.
    </p>
    <p>
        The political landscape of Gilded Juval is defined by corruption and a constant power struggle. Figures like
        Armid’Ro have manipulated political tensions, even plotting assassinations to create diplomatic crises and
        secure Juval's dominance over neighboring kingdoms like Valomor and Vilgmeri​. The kingdom is also home to a
        thriving assassin’s guild, where professional killers find ample work, given the volatile political environment
        and the frequent hiring of assassins by the elite​.
    </p>
    <p>
        Despite its glittering facade, the streets of Gilded Juval also reveal a darker side. The poor, referred to
        derogatorily as “jarner,” sell themselves into labor or worse, highlighting the dire conditions many inhabitants
        face. The life of the lower classes is often characterized by extreme poverty, with many engaging in menial work
        or even prostitution to survive​.
    </p>
    <p>
        The kingdom’s reliance on wealth and trade has led to a morally ambiguous environment, where decisions are
        driven more by profit than by ethical concerns. The rich revel in their power and luxury, while the poor remain
        trapped in a cycle of poverty, a grim reality that underscores the kingdom's glittering exterior​​​.
