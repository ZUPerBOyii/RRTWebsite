        Cusomi is a unique settlement situated outside the bustling city of Ertho Kal, which is a vibrant trade center.
        The journey to Cusomi involves traveling through colorful and surreal landscapes, with trees and flowers
        displaying unusual colors and strange animals roaming the fields. The village itself has an
        overgrown, rustic appearance, with houses covered in leaves and mold, and a sense of neglect that gives it an
        almost abandoned feeling. One of the central locations in Cusomi is an old house belonging to Zo Rei Wu, an
        eccentric and powerful enchanter. The house, despite its rundown appearance, is filled with magical artifacts,
        including a dusty library of magical tomes, brewing cauldrons, and various mystical ingredients.
