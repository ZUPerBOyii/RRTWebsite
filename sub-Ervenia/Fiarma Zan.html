        Fiarma Zan, known as the "Living City," is an unusual place marked by the coexistence of living and dead nature.
        One part of the city thrives with greenery and life, while another part lies dead and burning. This stark
        contrast gives the city its unique identity and atmosphere, embodying constant change.

        Fiarma Zan is renowned for its connection to Ervenian culinary traditions. The Ervenian kitchen is the city's
        specialty, and its dishes are particularly popular among sailors who frequently pass through the harbors of
        Ervenia. A notable dish is roasted rima, a green bird native to the inner cities of Ervenia.

        Fishing plays a vital role in Fiarma Zanâ€™s culture. It is not only a means of sustenance but also a favored
        recreational activity. The city hosts regular fishing competitions, where participants race to catch the most
        fish or the largest fish within a set time. This adds a layer of lively fun to the city, making it a place of
        endless entertainment.
