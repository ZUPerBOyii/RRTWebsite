        Ertho Kal is a bustling city within Ervenia, located by the sea and renowned for its dense urban layout. Many of
        its inhabitants reside on the outskirts, while the city center is the heart of commerce and trade. What makes
        Ertho Kal stand out is not just its vibrant marketplace, but also the unique way in which its economy operates.
        Instead of relying on metallic currency, the locals use a form of wooden currency produced from special trees in
        the northern forests. The people of Ertho Kal are deeply connected with nature, carefully interacting with it
        without causing harm.

        Among the notable landmarks of the city is the Initho Eza, also known as the "Trade Bringer," a large tower
        located in the center of Ertho Kal. This tower serves as a lighthouse, helping sailors navigate through the
        misty seas at night. Ertho Kal’s bay is constantly busy, with ships lining the shore to participate in the
        city’s bustling trade.
