        The Vanguards serve as an astral barrier, connecting a series of towers strategically placed around Valomor.
        These towers act as both physical and magical barriers, preventing entry to anyone who harbors ill intentions.
        They are especially important in maintaining the kingdom's defense and have been the site of numerous conflicts
        throughout history.

        Despite the frequent battles and their historical significance, the Vanguards continue to stand resilient, ever
        ready for future confrontations. Their durability and the protective magic that powers them make the Vanguards a
        key feature in the defense strategy of High Valomor. Over time, they have also come to symbolize the strength
        and resolve of the Valomorian people.
