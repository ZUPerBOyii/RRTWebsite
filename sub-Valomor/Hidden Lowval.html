        Hidden Lowval is an ancient city, deeply embedded beneath a forest, and serves as a secluded sanctuary for scholars
        who wish to separate themselves from the outside world. Its purpose is to provide a space where new and aspiring
        scholars can practice both astral magic and combat in peace, away from the distractions and disturbances of ordinary
        life​.
    </p>

    <p>
        Historically, Hidden Lowval has been known for its connection to the deeper mysteries of astral magic. The city
        holds immense significance for the scholarly community of Valomor, particularly for those studying astral arts, as
        it offers both the quiet necessary for deep contemplation and the facilities required for honing advanced magical
        skills. Scholars from all over High Valomor travel here to focus intensely on their studies, developing combat
        techniques, and mastering astral magic in relative isolation​​.
