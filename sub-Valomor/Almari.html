        The Almari are known for their highly honorable and elegant dueling culture, especially within the kingdom
        of High Valomor. These duels, known as Almari Duels, are a core tradition and exhibit the refined combat
        styles unique to Valomorian warriors. Over sixty different combat techniques exist within Almari alone,
        showcasing the kingdom's dedication to mastery in combat.

        In an Almari Duel, a weapon is selected using a "weapon wheel," a device spun to determine which weapon the
        duelists will use. The fight itself is non-lethal, and the rules prohibit the use of magic, focusing instead on
        astral weaponry and hand-to-hand combat. The objective is straightforward: the first combatant to knock their
        opponent down three times is declared the winner.

        Aside from the Almari Duels, Valomorians also hold Ceremonial Duels, which are focused entirely on astral
        combat. These ceremonial battles are especially significant, as they determine the next great scholar who will
        lead the kingdom. Unlike the Almari Duels, these fights delve deep into the realm of magic and intellect,
        shaping the political and scholarly future of High Valomor.
