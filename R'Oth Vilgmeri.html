    <p>R'Oth Vilgmeri is a kingdom that has undergone significant transformation over time, evolving from a once
        welcoming society to a highly nationalistic and insular realm. This shift was largely driven by an economic
        crisis caused by an influx of immigrants, which nearly collapsed the kingdom's economy. The societal reaction to
        this crisis led to a deep-seated mistrust and resentment toward outsiders, a sentiment that has been passed down
        through generations.
    </p>

    <p>
        The inhabitants are characterized as short-tempered and unkind, yet the kingdom hosts a resilient and
        well-known tavern, run by Jo'Ori, who has managed to create a place where even the most irritable locals can come
        together over drinks. The kingdom's history is also marked by significant conflicts, such as the First War, where
        Vilgmeri warriors fought valiantly, resulting in the loss of 1,200 Vilgmeri and 700 Valomorians.
