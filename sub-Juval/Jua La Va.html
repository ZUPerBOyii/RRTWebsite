        Jua La Va’s name has a curious origin, rooted in the ego of a political figure from Juval’s past. The city was
        originally founded by Ynis Lezvor Aintuli, a figure who rose to prominence due to his intelligence in national
        affairs. He devised a trade plan that bolstered the kingdom’s economy and significantly increased its
        self-reliance. The city was named in his honor, derived from the phrase Juami Lae Vam, which translates to "In
        his name." The success of his trade initiatives led to the city becoming one of the wealthiest and most
        technologically advanced in Juval. However, despite his initial popularity, Aintuli’s legacy is tainted by
        corruption and narcissism, and he was eventually assassinated under mysterious circumstances.
