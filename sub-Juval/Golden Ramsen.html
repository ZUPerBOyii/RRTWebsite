        Golden Ramsen thrives on its fast-paced trade and the opulent lifestyles of its inhabitants. Despite being a hub of
        wealth and success, Golden Ramsen also harbors a darker side: it is notorious for producing some of the most
        skilled assassins in all of Amalon.

        Celebrations are frequent in Golden Ramsen, with grand festivities occurring once every full moon. During these
        events, fireworks are launched into the sky, and the people of the city don vibrant and colorful clothing to
        dance and celebrate in hopes of becoming even wealthier. These celebrations are not just a reflection of the
        cityâ€™s immense prosperity but also a display of the ambition and competitiveness that drives the culture of
        Juval's elite
