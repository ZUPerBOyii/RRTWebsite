        The Outcast Coast, also known as the "Coast of the Cursed," is a desolate and dangerous region within the lands
        of Amalon, heavily linked to the tragic past of the Juvali people. It is steeped in grim history and shunned by
        the majority of the population due to its cursed reputation.
    </p>

    <p>
        After a devastating plague struck Juval, survivors who remained affected by the illness were forcibly outcast
        and sent to this distant shore. This brutal exile was meant to prevent the spread of the plague, but it also
        condemned many to a slow, torturous death. Starvation was rampant among those who were sent there, leading to
        desperate and horrific acts of cannibalism by some of the survivors. The harsh environment and lack of resources
        ensured that few lived long, and the reputation of the Outcast Coast as a cursed and forsaken place solidified
        over time.
    </p>

    <p>
        Even in the modern age, the coast remains a place to be avoided. The Juvali avoid it out of superstition,
        believing that the land itself has been tainted by the atrocities committed there. Some say that the curse still
        lingers, while others claim that strange occurrences happen near the coast, such as sudden disappearances and
        eerie, unexplainable sounds.
