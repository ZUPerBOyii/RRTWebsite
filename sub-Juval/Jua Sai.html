        Jua Sai is a somber and daunting city within the Kingdom of Gilded Juval, known for its morbid origins and
        current reputation as a city centered around grim tasks. Initially discovered by the original Juvali, the site
        was established as a cemetery. Over time, the city evolved from a graveyard into a functioning urban center, but
        it retained its strong association with death and labor.

    <p>
        The general work in Jua Sai revolves around heavy, arduous tasks like corpse disposal and laborious duties.
        These roles are typically performed by gravediggers, whose responsibilities have been passed down through
        generations. The city's atmosphere and cultural identity are deeply intertwined with these tasks, making it a
        place where death and hard labor are part of everyday life.
