    <p>
        The Unwelcomed City is a ghostly and desolate place, once a vibrant and welcoming city that has now fallen into
        ruin and eternal darkness. It stands as a shadow of its former self, with remnants of its once bustling streets
        and lively community now laying dormant forevermore. The city has earned its eerie reputation due to its current
        state—abandoned, silent, and steeped in mystery. The reasons behind its downfall are largely unknown, but it has
        since become a place avoided by travelers and locals alike, with stories of a dark past surrounding it​.
