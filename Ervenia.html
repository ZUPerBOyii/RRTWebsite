        Ervenia is a region known for its harmony with nature and its wonderous architecture. Its inhabitants are kind
        yet eccentric, and they have achieved a delicate balance between living in the natural world and advancing
        through magical innovations. The architecture of Ervenia is built with an appreciation for its surroundings,
        where even the trees and natural elements seem to be integrated into their structures, creating a unique and
        serene environment. The capital, Cusomi, stands out as a vibrant center of trade and culture.

        Ertho Kai is one of the most significant cities in Ervenia, noted for its bustling harbors that operate day and
        night, enabling a constant flow of goods. A lighthouse tower known as the Initho Eza, or the "Trade Bringer,"
        stands tall in the city, guiding ships safely through the misty seas.

        The people of Ervenia are also known for their craftsmanship, and some of their local delicacies, such as
        roasted rima, a green bird, are a favorite among sailors. Fishing is both a necessity and a popular recreational
        activity, with competitions often held to see who can catch the most fish in a limited time.
